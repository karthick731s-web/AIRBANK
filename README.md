AirBank is a menu-driven banking system developed in Java that simulates real-world banking operations. Users can create new accounts with an account number, holder name, and initial balance. The system allows users to deposit and withdraw money with proper validation for insufficient funds. All account data is stored in a text file (accounts.txt) using file handling (BufferedReader and BufferedWriter), ensuring persistent storage across program runs. Users can also view all accounts and search for a specific account by number. This project demonstrates practical application of OOP concepts, file handling, exception handling, and user interaction, making it a strong example of a mini Java project for learning and portfolio purposes.
